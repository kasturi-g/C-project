## Welcome to Calcu-basic
`Calcu-basic` is a C++ application that lets you calculate basic arithmetic operations. The purpose of our project is to let people modify our calculator and also make different results. You can copy the code, however you need to see our license first (https://github.com/TheRobotCodingMan/Calcu-basic/blob/main/LICENSE.MD)
## Features
The features of Calcu-Basic is in the following:

* Can do basic arithmetic calculations
* Can add up to 3 entries (numbers) (https://github.com/TheRobotCodingMan/Calcu-basic/issues/1)
* User can add up to 2 arithmetic operators (Example, when you add three numbers into the calculator, you can change the operator between the newly typed number and the second to the last typed number)

## Prerequisites for contributing to our project
You need to learn C++ basics to understand the code, but if you know c++, you probably know how the calculator works and how to improve it.

## How to compile code?
Compiling code in local is hard, but can be done. We recommend that you use an online c++ compiler. The link below has the code already and you can copy it:
